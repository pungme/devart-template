I'm finishing the most part of the work. For example, Camera, SMPT mail, flow of the application and some bugs are fixed. The prototype will be online soon. The design on the talking page was influenced from the poster of "The Social Network" movie where the typo caption fly over the Jesse Einsenberg face. It build the impressive and such an impact piece of advertisement. So that's my first idea on the interface design. 

As I said, core application is done without any interface design, I still need to work more on that.
