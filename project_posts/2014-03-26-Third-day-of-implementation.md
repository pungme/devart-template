Hey.

Today was really hard day. When I came back home the internet was down for 3 hours ! So I'm coding with my leftover battery and without internet for research..

So today I finished the most part of the work. Camera, SMPT mail, flow of the application and some bugs fixed. The prototype will be online soon. The design on the talking page was influenced from the poster of "The Social Network" movie where the typo caption fly over the Jesse Einsenberg face. It build the impressive and such an impact piece of advertisement. So that's my first idea on the interface design. 

As I said, core application is done without any interface design, I still need to work more on that.

Phew ! 2 days to go ! Good sign is, I started to feel the presence of my application, the more I did the more I felt relief and calm. I'm a bit surprise myself that I can do this thing within a short period of time(1 week) But I'm aware, comparing to other project, it's like day and night. But what ever the results is, it's fine for me :)
