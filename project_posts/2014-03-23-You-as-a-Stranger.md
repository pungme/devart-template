This post I will explain my initial draft of the project. The concept is very simple as the title says. "You as a Stranger".

The idea is to ask simple question, "Have you ever met yourself as a stranger ? So you might ask Is there something to do with the speech and talking stuff I've mention on my previous post ? I'll get to that in a minute.

Let me explain you how this works ( So you don't have to read that fuzzy image below). First of all, the main concept is to see yourself as a stranger or in other words as someone whom you don't know. When you step into this application, it ask you to take your picture and also your email. Then, application will show the picture of some person. It will ask you to say something honest about him/her. From here the application will convert your speech to text using google-api. Last but not least, application will sent what've just you said to that stranger by email. You can continue more or just wait in your inbox for what someone will think about you.
