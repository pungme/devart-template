On this post, I will explain my initial draft of the project and also run through the storyboard of user experience. The concept is very simple as the title says. "You as a Stranger".

The first idea is to ask simple question, "Have you ever met yourself as a stranger ? Then you might ask Is there something to do with the speech and talking stuff I've mention on my previous post ? I'll get to that in a minute.

Let me explain you how this works ( So you don't have to read that fuzzy image below). First of all, the main concept is to see yourself as a stranger or in other words as someone whom you don't know. When you step into this application, it ask you to take your picture and also your email. Then, application will show the picture of some person. It will ask you to say something honest about him/her. From here the application will convert your speech to text using google-api. Last but not least, application will sent whatever you've just you said to that stranger by email. You can continue more or just wait in your inbox for what someone will think about you.

This serve two things. First, another hidden community and second, the honesty of what we are thinking of someone. As I've mentioned on my previous post, to speak it out loud is more honest, you said what you're thinking(most of the time), it's more fresh and at somepoint, more intersting. 

I believe that the good art is the art that made you "felt" something. It should be simple enough not to confuse audience and also grab attention from mass group of people. I've thought throughly about it a lot and realize that the key is to make something about "them", about the audienc, about the subject. So that we did not make something too far-fetch from them. And also, the second important key is by using the something (a platform) as easy as just going to some webpage to do it. This will eliminate walls ofhesitation and influence people to have more contribution.

I think I'm kind of done for the concept, for my next post I'll move on to technical stuff that I've been trying to implement. 

See you on next post ! Peace !
