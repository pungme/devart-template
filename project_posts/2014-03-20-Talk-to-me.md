Ok, now I've got some initial thought about my project. It's not finalize and solid yet but I'm certainly feel somrthing from my guts that I want to do something involved with "talking". Because you know, to be straight, since we are entering the so called "Internet Empire" we communicate a lot but remarks that it mainly by "text". By bloging, facebook, twitter what'sapp and manymore. And turns out we do talk (or in the other words we're using speech) less than ever.

To talk and to write is totally different stuff. I used to be a writer and I kind of knew the diffence between think throughly and write it down or to improvise by talk it out loud in one punch. It felt that when you talk, it felt more honest on what you think. When you talk, it's harder to lie.

The idea is to develop the network-base artform that make talking meaningful again on internet era. But not too strait forward as talk and record your voice something like that. I'm thinking about something more causual and hybrid which then I ran into this text to speech idea. The good art is the art that make you feel something. So I tend to do that.

This is my idea so far. I'm pretty sure not much people gonna read this but it's okay. LOL

Peace !
